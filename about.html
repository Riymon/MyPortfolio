                <h1>About me</h1>
                 <p><span>I lived in Taboan, Cebu City, from 2009 to 2011. My parents grew up there.
                        The first school I attended was Regino Elementary School. 
                        I was quite hard-headed at the time however, I made many friends there. 
                        It was also during this period that I encountered a computer for the first time, 
                        sparking my curiosity about it. </span>
                    
                   <br><br>fast forward to  my teenage years when I was 15 years old I played a lot of online games, 
                    which further fueled my interest in computers. 
                    It wasnâ€™t long before I discovered Minecraft and its servers, 
                    which got me fascinated with configuring things. By the time I was in high school, 
                    I had already decided to pursue a program focused on computers or information technology. </span>
                    
                    <br><br><span>My curiosity about computers continues to shape who I am. 
                    While I may not consider myself the smartest person, I believe that with
                    hard work and dedication will lead me to succeed.!<span></span></p>
